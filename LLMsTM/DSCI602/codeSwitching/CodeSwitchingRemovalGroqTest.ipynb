        "## Overview\n",
        "This notebook translates **1,037 Hinglish/Marathi/code-mixed YouTube comments** to pure English using Groq's LLM API.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What This Does\n",
        "- **Input**: YouTube comments with code-switching (Hindi + English + Marathi mixed)\n",
        "- **Output**: Pure English translations in new column `csw-removed-comment`\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Remove linguistic noise to improve political bias classification\n",
        "\n",
        "### Models & Prompts Being Tested\n",
        "- **Model**:\n",
        "    \n",

        "### CSV Structure\n",
        "- **Input columns**: `Serial Number`, `text`, `relabel_llm_output`, `llm_model`, `Label_Topic`\n",
        "- **Output**: Same columns + new `csw-removed-comment` column\n",
        "\n",
        "### Features\n",
        "- Caching - Never translates the same comment twice  \n",
        "- Incremental saves - Progress saved every 50 rows  \n",
        "- Retry logic - Handles API failures automatically  \n",
        "- Rate limiting - Respects Groq API limits  \n",
