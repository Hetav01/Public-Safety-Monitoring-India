Dear Pune Police Department,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you with a heavy heart and a fervent plea for justice. Anish Awadhiya and Ashwini Costa, two beloved individuals, were tragically taken from us by the heinous act committed by Vedant Aggrawal. Their families are now enduring unimaginable grief and pain, and we are reaching out to you in desperate need of justice.

As I pen this letter, I cannot help but imagine the devastating impact such a tragedy would have if it befell my own family. The agony of losing a loved one to such a senseless act is beyond comprehension. Anish and Ashwini were not just names; they were sons, daughters, friends, and cherished members of our community. Their lives were full of promise and hope, brutally cut short by an act of violence.

The families of Anish and Ashwini are pleading for your intervention and support in ensuring that justice is served. They are not alone in this fight; the entire community stands with them, echoing their call for accountability and justice. We implore you to use all the resources at your disposal to investigate this case thoroughly and bring Vedant Aggrawal to justice for the heinous crime he has committed.

We trust in the integrity and dedication of the Pune Police Department. Your commitment to upholding the law and protecting the citizens of Pune is well-known, and we believe that you will handle this case with the urgency and seriousness it demands. Please do not let Anish and Ashwini's deaths be in vain. Their families deserve closure, and the community needs to see that justice prevails.

Thank you for your attention to this deeply distressing matter. We are confident that with your intervention, justice will be served, and the memory of Anish Awadhiya and Ashwini Costa will be honored.

1. Traffic law and order is pathetic in pune - Locals here dont follow any kind of traffic law i.e. no one wears helmets, red light jumping, wrong side driving is very very common here but the police never stops a pune vehicle or Marathis. They only harass outside vehicles and stop them for no reasons just to check NOC, pollution etc. just to extract money also if your vehicle is from up or bihar than get ready to face the hatred too.
2. After this incident police is going crazy on clubs, bars and restaurants which is affecting the business. And its true that cafes and bars are asking even 30 40 year olds for ids. Because of this all the places are empty rn and kinda dead. 
3. Although not related to this but still a very important point is the racism and biases that we non Marathis face on daily basis is pathetic. I came here last year from delhi for project work related and now i am going back but in this entire 1 year i have faced a lot of hatred from the locals and this really concerning when the government or police does this because than who will even protect me?

If your vehicle is from UP or Bihar, be prepared for even more harassment. Secondly, after this incident, the police are cracking down on clubs, bars, and restaurants, which is severely impacting their businesses. It's true that even 30-40 year olds are being asked for IDs, resulting in all these places being empty and dead.

Rahul lived with Shamshed in his house, they used to eat and drink together, and they became very good friends. One day, Shamshed met with an accident and underwent brain surgery two years ago.

When the investigation began, Rahul was caught and confessed that he had murdered Shamshed because three months ago, Shamshed had stolen a lot of his belongings. After that, Rahul sold all the stolen items and Shamshed beat him severely. When cuts were found on his body, Shamshed had rubbed chili powder and salt on them, and then Rahul apologized to him.
