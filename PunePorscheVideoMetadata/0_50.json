                "description": "The intervener in Pune car accident case Advocate Asim Saraode on May 22 while giving update on the case said the bail of the accused minor\u2019s father have been rejected and court have sent him in judicial custody till May 24. He further claimed that Police have been pressurized by someone in the case and FIR has been manipulated.  \nHe said, \u201cOn behalf of the intervener, we have argued against granting bail to the father of the accused. The court has rejected the basis on which he was asking for bail and granted him judicial custody till May 24... He tried to present an argument that he had sent a driver with his accused son. Then why was the driver not driving the car and the person with no licence was driving the car... I want to say with clarity that their association with gang members or their status as murderers has nothing to do with this case... The case is well discussed throughout the nation and the father is at fault as he failed to protect his minor son... There is absence of proper provisions to be mentioned in the FIR. Why has the police registered an offence and filed two FIRs is the question and it can be taken to the high court also. There is no mention of the prohibition act and its provisions and there is complete manipulation of the FIR. Maybe the police have been pressurised by someone and that is why they are trying to mislead the court on some level but now societal pressure is compelling the police to be on track of the law.\u201d \n\n#puneaccident #vedantagarwal #porsche \n\nJoin ANI's YouTube membership to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtFQDgA8J8_iiwc5-KoAQlg/join\n\nSubscribe now and press the bell icon \ud83d\udd14 to get new video updates: https://bit.ly/2UV4ygi\n--------------------------------------\nANI is South Asia's leading Multimedia News Agency providing content for every information platform, including TV, Internet, broadband, newspapers, and mobiles. \nSubscribe now!

                "description": "Pune Accident: The 17-year-old boy at the wheel of the speeding Porsche that hit a bike in Pune Saturday night, killing a man and a woman, was out on bail 15 hours after he was arrested. His lawyer Prashant Patil said a court granted bail to the minor on conditions -- he has to work with traffic police in Yerwada for 15 days, write an essay on accidents, undergo treatment for his drinking habit, and take counselling sessions. The accused is the son of a prominent Pune realtor.\n\nTwenty-four-year-olds Aneesh Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta, both engineers from Madhya Pradesh working in Pune, were returning on a bike after attending a get-together with friends. The Porsche, which eyewitnesses have said was driving at over 200 km per hour and had no number plates, hit the bike. Ashwini was thrown about 20 feet in the air and landed hard, said an eyewitness.

                    "description": "Pune Accident: The 17-year-old boy at the wheel of the speeding Porsche that hit a bike in Pune Saturday night, killing a man and a woman, was out on bail 15 hours after he was arrested. His lawyer Prashant Patil said a court granted bail to the minor on conditions -- he has to work with traffic police in Yerwada for 15 days, write an essay on accidents, undergo treatment for his drinking habit, and take counselling sessions. The accused is the son of a prominent Pune realtor.\n\nTwenty-four-year-olds Aneesh Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta, both engineers from Madhya Pradesh working in Pune, were returning on a bike after attending a get-together with friends. The Porsche, which eyewitnesses have said was driving at over 200 km per hour and had no number plates, hit the bike. Ashwini was thrown about 20 feet in the air and landed hard, said an eyewitness. Aneesh was thrown at a parked car and suffered serious injuries. Both died on the spot.\n\n#Pune #PuneAccident #PunePorscheAccident #Porsche #PorschePune #Engineers #TeenGetsBail\n\r\nAbout NDTV (English news channel):\r\n\r\nNDTV is India's Most-Trusted News Broadcaster with the latest updates in news, sports, entertainment and much more from within India and around the world.

                "description": "In an exclusive conversation with Republic Media Network's Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami, the Pune Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar has admitted that the NCP MLA visited the police station within hours of the Porsche crash that killed two young techies on the spot. \u201cHe did visit the police station. I can\u2019t stop him,\" Kumar told Arnab when confronted on LIVE TV. \n\nQuestioned further about the motive of the MLA's visit to the police station, Amitesh Kumar said, \"He may come for whatever he wants\"\n\nProbed further by Arnab on the exact reason for MLAs visit and it was people's right to know why the MLA visited the police station, Kumar said, \"YES, YOU HAVE THE FULL RIGHT, THE AUDIENCE HAVE THE FULL RIGHT TO KNOW, YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT A PUBLIC REPRESENTATIVE HAVE THE RIGHT TO VISIT THE POLICE STATION, WE CANNOT BAR HIs ENTRY.\"\n\nPune top cop however refused to comment on the motive of the NCP MLA visiting the police station. \n\nOn being repeatedly asked to disclose the motive behind the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA visiting the police station and why he was entertained by the police, the police commissioner denied commenting on the motive of his visit, however, he said that the MLA was not entertained by the police.\n\nMaking a confirmation that the MLA didn\u2019t try to put pressure on the police on behalf of the accused in the case, Amitesh Kumar further stated that the police station is a public place, so the MLA visited there.\n\n\"EVERYONE IS FREE TO TELL WHATEVER THEY WANT TO, WHAT WE HAVE TO DO DEPENDS ON THE LAW, THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE DONE, I AM VERY VERY CLEAR,\" Kumar said. \n\nKumar also appeared to be attempting to dodge the question, when he was asked if he was giving a clean chit to the MLA over allegations that he was trying to pressure the police, the police commissioner said that one needs to look at the end results.\n\nRefusing to comment on the order passed by the Juvenile Justice Board or the courts, Pune Police Commissioner, Amitesh Kumar stated, \u201cI can say that the most stringent path which was possible has been adopted in this case right from Sunday morning. The act of applying section 304 of the IPC which is culpable homicide not amounting to murder, has 10 years of punishment. Our suo-motu action of moving the action to try him as an adult under the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, because the said accident is a heinous crime, was all done on Sunday itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch before the media and the public outrage, we had booked the father and the pub owners and managers under sections 75 and 77 of the JJ Act, which I would say would be the first of the few incidents where the father has been booked and section 77 has been invoked against those who served liquor to underage people,\u201d the Pune\u00a0top\u00a0cop\u00a0said.\n\n#arnabgoswami #punepolice #AmiteshKumar #debatewitharnab  #PunePorscheCrash #puneporscheaccident  #LatestNews #RepublicTV #RepublicTVLive \n\nRepublic TV is India's no.1 English news channel since its launch.

                    "description": "In an exclusive conversation with Republic Media Network's Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami, the Pune Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar has admitted that the NCP MLA visited the police station within hours of the Porsche crash that killed two young techies on the spot. \u201cHe did visit the police station. I can\u2019t stop him,\" Kumar told Arnab when confronted on LIVE TV. \n\nQuestioned further about the motive of the MLA's visit to the police station, Amitesh Kumar said, \"He may come for whatever he wants\"\n\nProbed further by Arnab on the exact reason for MLAs visit and it was people's right to know why the MLA visited the police station, Kumar said, \"YES, YOU HAVE THE FULL RIGHT, THE AUDIENCE HAVE THE FULL RIGHT TO KNOW, YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT A PUBLIC REPRESENTATIVE HAVE THE RIGHT TO VISIT THE POLICE STATION, WE CANNOT BAR HIs ENTRY.\"\n\nPune top cop however refused to comment on the motive of the NCP MLA visiting the police station. \n\nOn being repeatedly asked to disclose the motive behind the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA visiting the police station and why he was entertained by the police, the police commissioner denied commenting on the motive of his visit, however, he said that the MLA was not entertained by the police.\n\nMaking a confirmation that the MLA didn\u2019t try to put pressure on the police on behalf of the accused in the case, Amitesh Kumar further stated that the police station is a public place, so the MLA visited there.\n\n\"EVERYONE IS FREE TO TELL WHATEVER THEY WANT TO, WHAT WE HAVE TO DO DEPENDS ON THE LAW, THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE DONE, I AM VERY VERY CLEAR,\" Kumar said. \n\nKumar also appeared to be attempting to dodge the question, when he was asked if he was giving a clean chit to the MLA over allegations that he was trying to pressure the police, the police commissioner said that one needs to look at the end results.\n\nRefusing to comment on the order passed by the Juvenile Justice Board or the courts, Pune Police Commissioner, Amitesh Kumar stated, \u201cI can say that the most stringent path which was possible has been adopted in this case right from Sunday morning. The act of applying section 304 of the IPC which is culpable homicide not amounting to murder, has 10 years of punishment. Our suo-motu action of moving the action to try him as an adult under the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, because the said accident is a heinous crime, was all done on Sunday itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch before the media and the public outrage, we had booked the father and the pub owners and managers under sections 75 and 77 of the JJ Act, which I would say would be the first of the few incidents where the father has been booked and section 77 has been invoked against those who served liquor to underage people,\u201d the Pune\u00a0top\u00a0cop\u00a0said.\n\n#arnabgoswami #punepolice #AmiteshKumar #debatewitharnab  #PunePorscheCrash #puneporscheaccident  #LatestNews #RepublicTV #RepublicTVLive \n\nRepublic TV is India's no.1 English news channel since its launch.

An eyewitness has come forward with a chilling account, confirming that the teenage driver, hailing from a wealthy family, was indeed drunk and speeding when he mowed down techies Aneesh and Ashwini on a bike. The teen's family allegedly bribed doctors at a Pune government hospital to switch blood samples, attempting to absolve the boy. Despite denials from the families of Dr. Tawre and hospital staffer Atul Ghatkamble, bribe money was found at Ghatkamble's home. Another hospital staffer from the blood testing department is on the run, suspected of involvement in the sample swapping.

A 17-year-old, driving a Porsche, hit a motorbike rider, tragically killing two people. The irony? He was granted bail immediately, with the judge merely instructing him to write an essay on road safety.\n\nThis incident has fueled a widespread outcry about the apparent double standards in our justice system. Why do the rich and powerful often escape harsh penalties after committing crimes? We draw parallels to notorious cases like the Manu Sharma case, the Jessica Lal murder, Salman Khan\u2019s hit-and-run, and the 1999 BMW hit-and-run incident, all highlighting a disturbing pattern of leniency towards affluent offenders.\n\nWe also shed light on a harsh reality: over half of the people in Indian jails are languishing there for petty crimes, simply because they cannot afford even a small amount for bail. This stark contrast underscores the urgent need for reform in our judicial system to ensure equality and justice for all, regardless of socio-economic status.\n\nJoin us as we explore this critical issue, examining the intersection of wealth, privilege, and justice in India.
