                "description": "Pune officials have sealed a city bar that served alcohol to a 17-year-old boy and his friends, after which the drunk teen drove and rammed a Porsche sports car into a bike carrying two people, both of whom were killed. CCTV footage from inside the premises confirmed liquor had been served to the boy and his friends. The legal drinking age in the state of Maharashtra is 25, which means it was illegal to serve liquor to the boy or his friends. The youngster was produced before the Juvenile Justice Board which granted him bail hours later. It also directed him to visit the Regional Transport Office and study traffic rules, and submit a presentation to the Board within 15 days. The teenager was directed to write an essay of 300 words on the topic of road accidents and their solutions. The board also directed the youth to be referred to an alcohol deaddiction centre for counselling. The quick bail in a case where two people had died, had drawn widespread criticism. The father of the teenager, as well as the owners of a couple of bars where the minor was served alcohol, have been arrested.\n\n#Punecrash #alcohol #porsche\n\nMoneycontrol is India's leading financial and business portal with in-depth market coverage, analysis, expert opinions, and a gamut of financial tools.\nA part of Network18, moneycontrol.com is the most influential destination for stock market news and advice, business news, and news about the Indian and global economy.\nSubscribe: https://bit.ly/moneycontrolyoutube\nFollow us:\nVisit https://www.moneycontrol.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/moneycontrol/\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/moneycontrolcom\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/moneycontrolcom/",

                "description": "The father of the 17-year-old boy has been arrested by Pune Police from Maharashtra's Aurangabad. \nThe name old his father is Vishal Agrawal who is a a real estate developer. Following the accident, an FIR was lodged against Vishal Agrawal, and the accused immediately made escape plans.\nIn a bid to dodge capture, Agrawal executed a clever scheme. He initially drove his regular car towards Mumbai accompanied by his driver. Meanwhile, he dispatched another vehicle towards Goa and Kolhapur, throwing authorities off his trail. Throughout his escape, he kept his family in the dark, feeding them false information about his destination, insisting he was in route to Mumbai.\nAgrawal took further steps to evade detection by switching off his main phone and adopting a new number to avoid tracking. Despite his efforts, authorities managed to trace his movements through the GPS of a friend's car, which he utilized to visit different places, including his farmhouse in Daund and properties in Pune.\nUsing advanced technology and GPS tracking, Pune Crime Branch teams worked diligently to locate Agrawal. They used CCTV footage and intercepted messages sent by Agrawal to his family. Finally, their efforts paid off when they found him hiding in a small lodge in Sambhajinagar.\n#puneaccident #pune \nAbout Channel:  \n\nYour daily dose of videos for the latest and exclusive news from India and the rest of the world.

                    "description": "The father of the 17-year-old boy has been arrested by Pune Police from Maharashtra's Aurangabad. \nThe name old his father is Vishal Agrawal who is a a real estate developer. Following the accident, an FIR was lodged against Vishal Agrawal, and the accused immediately made escape plans.\nIn a bid to dodge capture, Agrawal executed a clever scheme. He initially drove his regular car towards Mumbai accompanied by his driver. Meanwhile, he dispatched another vehicle towards Goa and Kolhapur, throwing authorities off his trail. Throughout his escape, he kept his family in the dark, feeding them false information about his destination, insisting he was in route to Mumbai.\nAgrawal took further steps to evade detection by switching off his main phone and adopting a new number to avoid tracking. Despite his efforts, authorities managed to trace his movements through the GPS of a friend's car, which he utilized to visit different places, including his farmhouse in Daund and properties in Pune.\nUsing advanced technology and GPS tracking, Pune Crime Branch teams worked diligently to locate Agrawal. They used CCTV footage and intercepted messages sent by Agrawal to his family. Finally, their efforts paid off when they found him hiding in a small lodge in Sambhajinagar.\n#puneaccident #pune \nAbout Channel:  \n\nYour daily dose of videos for the latest and exclusive news from India and the rest of the world.

                "description": "Pune Accident: The 17-year-old boy at the wheel of the speeding Porsche that hit a bike in Pune Saturday night, killing a man and a woman, was out on bail 15 hours after he was arrested. His lawyer Prashant Patil said a court granted bail to the minor on conditions -- he has to work with traffic police in Yerwada for 15 days, write an essay on accidents, undergo treatment for his drinking habit, and take counselling sessions. The accused is the son of a prominent Pune realtor.\n\nTwenty-four-year-olds Aneesh Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta, both engineers from Madhya Pradesh working in Pune, were returning on a bike after attending a get-together with friends. The Porsche, which eyewitnesses have said was driving at over 200 km per hour and had no number plates, hit the bike. Ashwini was thrown about 20 feet in the air and landed hard, said an eyewitness. Aneesh was thrown at a parked car and suffered serious injuries. Both died on the spot.\n\n#Pune #PuneAccident #PunePorscheAccident #Porsche #PorschePune #Engineers #TeenGetsBail\n\nAbout NDTV (English news channel):\n\nNDTV is India's Most-Trusted News Broadcaster with the latest updates in news, sports, entertainment and much more from within India and around the world.

                    "description": "Pune Accident: The 17-year-old boy at the wheel of the speeding Porsche that hit a bike in Pune Saturday night, killing a man and a woman, was out on bail 15 hours after he was arrested. His lawyer Prashant Patil said a court granted bail to the minor on conditions -- he has to work with traffic police in Yerwada for 15 days, write an essay on accidents, undergo treatment for his drinking habit, and take counselling sessions. The accused is the son of a prominent Pune realtor.\n\nTwenty-four-year-olds Aneesh Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta, both engineers from Madhya Pradesh working in Pune, were returning on a bike after attending a get-together with friends. The Porsche, which eyewitnesses have said was driving at over 200 km per hour and had no number plates, hit the bike. Ashwini was thrown about 20 feet in the air and landed hard, said an eyewitness. Aneesh was thrown at a parked car and suffered serious injuries. Both died on the spot.\n\n#Pune #PuneAccident #PunePorscheAccident #Porsche #PorschePune #Engineers #TeenGetsBail\n\nAbout NDTV (English news channel):\n\nNDTV is India's Most-Trusted News Broadcaster with the latest updates in news, sports, entertainment and much more from within India and around the world.

The Parsi Gymkhana, spanning 10 acres in Mahabaleshwar, was leased to the Parsi Trust by the state government for 30 years. In 2016, S.K. Agarwal joined the Trust's committee, followed by Usha Agarwal. By 2020, Parsi committee members were replaced by Vishal Agarwal, Shivani Agarwal, Shrey Vishal Agarwal, and Abhishek Gupta. Originally intended for residential use, the gymkhana was converted into a commercial resort, and leased to the hotel brand Regenta.

The Parsi Gymkhana, spanning 10 acres in Mahabaleshwar, was leased to the Parsi Trust by the state government for 30 years. In 2016, S.K. Agarwal joined the Trust's committee, followed by Usha Agarwal. By 2020, Parsi committee members were replaced by Vishal Agarwal, Shivani Agarwal, Shrey Vishal Agarwal, and Abhishek Gupta. Originally intended for residential use, the gymkhana was converted into a commercial resort, and leased to the hotel brand Regenta. The district administration is now taking action against the resort for defrauding the government and violating regulations.\n\n#puneporscheaccident #puneaccident #porsche #latestnews #breakingnews #resort #bulldozer #demolition #razed #mahabaleshwar #districtadministration #regenta \n\n Full Story On:  https://www.republicworld.com\n\n#BreakingNews #RepublicTV #RepublicTVLive \n\npune porsche accident,pune accident,pune car accident,pune porsche car accident,porsche,pune,pune accident cctv,pune car accident porsche car video,Ajit Pawar To Meet Top Cop Amid Controversy,Over Blood Swap,juvenile justice board,pune crime branch,pune police,permission,super brat,Exclusive Leads In Pune Porsche Crash Case,Crime Branch Seeks Nod To Record Super Brat Statement,VVIP Brat's Mother Shivani Agarwal Arrested\n\nRepublic TV is India's no.1 English news channel since its launch.

                "description": "The Pune Porsche accident has gripped the  nation's attention for the past 11 days. In a latest update, Pune Police Crime Branch has seized a Mercedes which is believed to have been used in the abduction of the driver involved in the incident on May 28th. They've recorded a fresh statement from the driver involved in the incident. Wherein he confirmed and identified the car used in his abduction. Initially, he had claimed it was a BMW, but CCTV evidence contradicts his statement.  The Father and grandfather of the minor accused have been booked for kidnapping the driver after the incident. Meanwhile Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on May 27 said that the police have revealed that the blood samples of the accused had been replaced with other samples and that the Police will not stop until this case gets to its root.\n#puneaccident #punenews #pune #puneporscheaccident #news \nNo one knows Mumbai better than us. #madeinmumbai. \nFor more Bollywood, news and sports videos subscribe here: http://bit.ly/2KUYCyq\n\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/middayindia\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/mid_day\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/middayindia",
