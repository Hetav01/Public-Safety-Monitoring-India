                "description": "Pune officials have sealed a city bar that served alcohol to a 17-year-old boy and his friends, after which the drunk teen drove and rammed a Porsche sports car into a bike carrying two people, both of whom were killed. CCTV footage from inside the premises confirmed liquor had been served to the boy and his friends. The legal drinking age in the state of Maharashtra is 25, which means it was illegal to serve liquor to the boy or his friends. The youngster was produced before the Juvenile Justice Board which granted him bail hours later. It also directed him to visit the Regional Transport Office and study traffic rules, and submit a presentation to the Board within 15 days. The teenager was directed to write an essay of 300 words on the topic of road accidents and their solutions. The board also directed the youth to be referred to an alcohol deaddiction centre for counselling. The quick bail in a case where two people had died, had drawn widespread criticism. The father of the teenager, as well as the owners of a couple of bars where the minor was served alcohol, have been arrested.\n\n#pune #puneaccident #porsche #carcrash #news18 #cnnnews18 \n\nNews18 Mobile App - https://onelink.to/desc-youtube",

The head of the hospital's forensic department is among those arrested. The case, now under the crime branch's investigation, involves a fatal crash where two IT professionals died after being hit by a Porsche allegedly driven by the intoxicated minor on May 19. Following public outrage over the lenient treatment initially given by the Juvenile Justice Board, the teen has been sent to an observation home until June 5.
