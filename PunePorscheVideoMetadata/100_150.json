There are two main issues with this episode: how the rich find their way around the legal system and the blatant lack of road safety in India. This is what we will address in this video. \n\n\ud83d\udcc3Sources: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1smm0cfjxEHK9HKXbHu4wb_hL1Wce2SMfrdH1eZGtr7U/edit?usp=sharing\n\n******\n\n\ud83d\udd0d\u270d\ufe0fResearch: \nMohit Priyadarshi: https://twitter.com/mohitprior\nZaira Khan: https://www.linkedin.com/in/zaira-khan-7435a9189\nNidheesh Manipal: https://www.instagram.com/nidheeshmanipal/\nAntara: https://www.instagram.com/that_musical_note/\n\n\u2702\ufe0f\ud83c\udf9b\ufe0fEditing: \nYash Vyas:https://www.instagram.com/yashvyas24/\nCharanTej: https://www.instagram.com/mograph.charantej/\nUtpal Singh Jadon: https://www.linkedin.com/in/utpalsinghjadon/\nAjeesh Babu:  https://www.instagram.com/ajeesh_babu/\nAditya Chowdhury : https://www.instagram.com/infjt_me\nShreyas Jahagirdar: https://twitter.com/shreyasnvids\n\n\ud83c\udfa8Thumbnail :\nAanchal Verma: https://www.instagram.com/aanchal_creates/\n\nWant to work with us?

There are two main issues with this episode: how the rich find their way around the legal system and the blatant lack of road safety in India. This is what we will address in this video. \n\n\ud83d\udcc3Sources: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1smm0cfjxEHK9HKXbHu4wb_hL1Wce2SMfrdH1eZGtr7U/edit?usp=sharing\n\n******\n\n\ud83d\udd0d\u270d\ufe0fResearch: \nMohit Priyadarshi: https://twitter.com/mohitprior\nZaira Khan: https://www.linkedin.com/in/zaira-khan-7435a9189\nNidheesh Manipal: https://www.instagram.com/nidheeshmanipal/\nAntara: https://www.instagram.com/that_musical_note/\n\n\u2702\ufe0f\ud83c\udf9b\ufe0fEditing: \nYash Vyas:https://www.instagram.com/yashvyas24/\nCharanTej: https://www.instagram.com/mograph.charantej/\nUtpal Singh Jadon: https://www.linkedin.com/in/utpalsinghjadon/\nAjeesh Babu:  https://www.instagram.com/ajeesh_babu/\nAditya Chowdhury : https://www.instagram.com/infjt_me\nShreyas Jahagirdar: https://twitter.com/shreyasnvids\n\n\ud83c\udfa8Thumbnail :\nAanchal Verma: https://www.instagram.com/aanchal_creates/\n\nWant to work with us?

                "description": "After the Juvenile Justice Board granted bail to a teenager involved in a car accident that killed two people, Pune police are looking to prosecute him as an adult accused. The Porsche car allegedly driven by the 17-year-old, who the police claim was drunk at the time, knocked down two persons on a motorbike, killing them at the spot. The youngster was produced before the Juvenile Justice Board which granted him bail hours later. It also directed him to visit the Regional Transport Office and study traffic rules, and submit a presentation to the Board within 15 days. The teenager was directed to write an essay of 300 words on the topic of road accidents and their solutions. The board also directed the youth to be referred to an alcohol deaddiction centre for counselling. The quick bail in a case where two people had died, had drawn widespread criticism. The father of the teenager, as well as the owners of a couple of bars where the minor was served alcohol, have been arrested.\n\n#pune #puneaccident #porsche #carcrash #news18 #cnnnews18 \n\nNews18 Mobile App - https://onelink.to/desc-youtube",

                    "description": "After the Juvenile Justice Board granted bail to a teenager involved in a car accident that killed two people, Pune police are looking to prosecute him as an adult accused. The Porsche car allegedly driven by the 17-year-old, who the police claim was drunk at the time, knocked down two persons on a motorbike, killing them at the spot. The youngster was produced before the Juvenile Justice Board which granted him bail hours later. It also directed him to visit the Regional Transport Office and study traffic rules, and submit a presentation to the Board within 15 days. The teenager was directed to write an essay of 300 words on the topic of road accidents and their solutions. The board also directed the youth to be referred to an alcohol deaddiction centre for counselling. The quick bail in a case where two people had died, had drawn widespread criticism. The father of the teenager, as well as the owners of a couple of bars where the minor was served alcohol, have been arrested.\n\n#pune #puneaccident #porsche #carcrash #news18 #cnnnews18 \n\nNews18 Mobile App - https://onelink.to/desc-youtube"

The sample, initially collected at Sassoon General Hospital, was allegedly switched with the minor\u2019s mother's sample. The teenager's father, mother, and their aide, Ashfaque Makandar, have been presented before the special court. Additionally, the father faces new charges of cheating and criminal breach of trust related to a separate case filed by a resident of Pimpri Chinchwad.\n..............................................................................................\nNews9 is India's first fully integrated English news brand across all digital platforms.
