                "description": "Pune Porsche Accident: Drama Outside Sessions Court, Ink Thrown On Father Of Accused Minor. \n\nhead of the hearing before Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), Pune police added some more sections against 17-year-old accused. Apart from section 185 of the Motor Vehicle Act (driving by a drunken person), sections 184 (action against those who violate traffic rules through rash or dangerous driving), 119 (age limit in connection with driving of motor vehicles) and 177 (general provision for punishment of offences) have been added.\n\nThe juvenile justice board heard the application of Pune police to try the 17-year-old accused as an adult. The JJB has reserved the order and may pronounce it between 4 and 4:30 pm.\n\nA Porsche car allegedly driven by the teenager, who the police claim was drunk at the time, fatally knocked down two motorbike-borne software engineers in Kalyani Nagar in Pune city in the early hours of Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, the father of the 17-year-old, Vishal Agarwal, a real estate developer, will also be produced before a session court around 3 pm.\n\nThe police had registered a case against the teenager\u2019s father under sections 75 and 77 of the Juvenile Justice Act and relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Section 75 deals with \u201cwillful neglect of a child, or exposing a child to mental or physical illnesses,\u201d while section 77 deals with supplying a child with intoxicating liquor or drugs.\n\nAccording to the FIR lodged in connection with the incident, the man, despite knowing his son did not have a valid driving license, gave him the car, thus endangering the latter\u2019s life. He also allowed his on to party despite knowing he consumes liquor.\n\n#PunePorscheCrashcase #PuneCarCrash #punenews #Porsche #Minor #Court #cnbctv18digital #cnbctv18",

                    "description": "Pune Porsche Accident: Drama Outside Sessions Court, Ink Thrown On Father Of Accused Minor. \n\nhead of the hearing before Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), Pune police added some more sections against 17-year-old accused. Apart from section 185 of the Motor Vehicle Act (driving by a drunken person), sections 184 (action against those who violate traffic rules through rash or dangerous driving), 119 (age limit in connection with driving of motor vehicles) and 177 (general provision for punishment of offences) have been added.\n\nThe juvenile justice board heard the application of Pune police to try the 17-year-old accused as an adult. The JJB has reserved the order and may pronounce it between 4 and 4:30 pm.\n\nA Porsche car allegedly driven by the teenager, who the police claim was drunk at the time, fatally knocked down two motorbike-borne software engineers in Kalyani Nagar in Pune city in the early hours of Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, the father of the 17-year-old, Vishal Agarwal, a real estate developer, will also be produced before a session court around 3 pm.\n\nThe police had registered a case against the teenager\u2019s father under sections 75 and 77 of the Juvenile Justice Act and relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Section 75 deals with \u201cwillful neglect of a child, or exposing a child to mental or physical illnesses,\u201d while section 77 deals with supplying a child with intoxicating liquor or drugs.\n\nAccording to the FIR lodged in connection with the incident, the man, despite knowing his son did not have a valid driving license, gave him the car, thus endangering the latter\u2019s life. He also allowed his on to party despite knowing he consumes liquor.\n\n#PunePorscheCrashcase #PuneCarCrash #punenews #Porsche #Minor #Court #cnbctv18digital #cnbctv18"
