This law is made by parliament, not courts. \\n2. Juvenile courts work according to the juvenile justice act, which is very sensitive about care and protection of juveniles. The judge can't act out of his personal emotions and has to adhere to law made by the legislature. \\n3. The bail conditions imposed are  not exclusive to this case , but these are imposed in many juvenile cases for correction measures. \\n\\nSo, while i totally condemn the acts of the juvenile and want juvenile court to treat him strictly as per law so that others also fear in repeating the mistake, but at the same time this social media trial by influencers is also not healthy for the independent judiciary. The general public doesn't understand technical legal aspects of things, so they just blame judges and courts whenever they're not happy with a case. \\nFor example people are saying why the court opened on a Sunday to give him bail, but they don't know that there's always a judge on duty on every holiday for urgent work like remand and bail. \\nSo please make a video on not blaming courts without knowing the law, and The menace of the media trial. Thankyou.\",\n",

After this incident happened instead of taking the case serious what pune police did was to cancel FL3 license of all the nightlife organisation in the city. Also those clubs which had official license till 3 am in Mumbai is closing by 1 am. \\nBcoz of this reason its not only the DJ and artist but also 60k workers in this organisation are in the verge to lose their jobs. \\nNight life organisations are every where in the world and if a crime happened its not just the fault of the clubs. Like u mentioned the only mistake which has happened from the club side is giving entry to a minor. In a country where ministers are able to make fake degree how much time will a genz take to create a fake ID. \\nWhat i have been suggesting is cancelling the FL3 license is not the way moving forward, instead night clubs shd check the age for every customer via Digi Locker app. Secondly government shd consider night life organisation as a business entity too. whatever happens in the world we our industry is the first to get effected and last to recover. After the hit by covid this industry was slowly recovering but then again in the name of election and VIP moment the places was shut and now bcoz of a spoil brat doing this accident its not just 2 life lost, here we are going to see 60k or more than that pple loosing there jobs. \\nU have been raising the voice for all right reasons, i hope u can make atlest a reel video about the loss in employment and how each and every factor effects Nightlife industry. If ur keen to make a seperate video on Nightlife Industry of India i will be more than happy to be of ur help. u can contact me via Instagram under the user name djzafff. \\nThanks man. May the Democracy win.',\n",

My name is Aryan Malhotra, and I am here to apologize for the irreparable harm I have caused. On the night of May 15th, I made the disastrous decision to drive my father's Porsche while intoxicated. This reckless act resulted in a tragic accident that took the lives of two young individuals, Priya Sharma and Rohit Patel.\\n\\nWords cannot adequately express the depth of my sorrow and the remorse I feel. I cannot imagine the pain and suffering I have inflicted upon the families and friends of Priya and Rohit. Their lives were cut short because of my thoughtlessness, and for that, I am deeply sorry. I realize now, more than ever, the value of human life and the irreversible damage that a single moment of poor judgment can cause.\\n\\nAs the son of a prominent businessman, I have lived a life of privilege and comfort. However, this privilege does not absolve me of responsibility; rather, it holds me to a higher standard of accountability. I failed to uphold that standard, and my actions have led to unbearable grief and loss.\\n\\nI want to assure everyone that I am committed to facing the consequences of my actions and learning from this tragedy. I understand that no amount of remorse can bring back Priya and Rohit, but I pledge to dedicate my life to making amends and ensuring that such a tragedy never occurs again. I will work tirelessly to raise awareness about the dangers of drunk driving and to support initiatives that prevent such senseless acts.\\n\\nTo the families of Priya Sharma and Rohit Patel, I extend my deepest condolences and heartfelt apologies. I know that my words cannot heal your wounds, but I hope that, in time, my actions will demonstrate the sincerity of my regret and my commitment to honoring the memory of your loved ones.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I am profoundly sorry for the pain I have caused and the lives I have destroyed. I will spend the rest of my life seeking redemption and striving to be a better person. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to express my remorse.\",\n",

It is such a miracle which will remain as evidence of his prophethood until the end of the world.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, Prophet Moses’ miracles included crossing the Red Sea and striking the rock for water to gush out thereof. Prophet Jesus’ miracles included making water into wine, causing two thousand pigs to be killed and causing the fig tree to dry up.\\n\\nNevertheless, those miracles were limited to the times and places of those two prophets, and they became a history found only in books, for which there is no existing evidence. They may seem as fairy tales for some people.\\n\\nStill, the Qur’an is Prophet Muhammad’s visual, live and eternal miracle. It will remain as reliable evidence of Prophet Muhammad’s prophethood until the Day of Judgment.\\n\\nNowadays, in the twenty first century, you can verify the Qur’an as a miracle testifying for the prophethood of Prophet Muhammad, whereas we do not find any evidence of the prophethood of Moses or Jesus or the miracles God performed at their hands.\\n\\nWatch this video to know Prophet Muhammad’s major miracles and the difference between them and those of the rest of the prophets and messengers, including Moses and Jesus.',\n",

It's a great city and I really miss it, very beautiful city, great climate, young, vibrant, highly educated crowd, IT hub, great place to live, it's all of that but the traffic is worst over there. Regarding this incident I can only say one thing, in India anyone who has power, money and influence they can get away with anything. It' such a sad and hopeless reality for us even when it's 2024 and nothing has really changed in all these times! Amrit kaal and all of these words are such a nonsense, don't mean anything..... Such a shame.\",\n",

       "  {'text': 'Adding onto your points, if India wants to improve:\\n1) Reduce voting age to 16, a country like India where students have to literally spend 10-14 hours studying a day to be able to crack basic competitive exams needs this. They deserve the right to vote because the decisions of political parties i.e. expenditure on education, R and D, work laws, etc. directly affects them. If they\\'re mature enough to face the pressure of these \"rejection exams\", they\\'re mature enough to make political decisions.\\n2) Educated politicians. We\\'ve all read the NCERT when we were kids where they justified not having a minimum qualification for contesting elections based on trying to give everyone an opportunity. That never resonanted with me because we all know that the cost of elections in India is supremely high. How exactly does an uneducated person become filthy rich to be able to contest elections? Through inheritance or crime. A minimum board percentage in 10th and 12th and a basic qualification is vital for the rulers of our country (just like upsc).\\n3) Reduce cost of elections. Set a strict cap on the amount that can be spent on elections, anyone who doesn\\'t comply should be instantly disqualified. This will reduce the power of the rich on politicians and India. Further this would also work to reduce the rich poor divide in India when the less fortunate will be able to contest elections and bring representation to their masses.\\n4) **THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL** A country like India cannot function with foreign concepts of \"universal adult franchise\", only the educated should be allowed to vote. It is easy to manipulate the uneducated based on religion, money, etc.. With the onset of the education revolution, this point doesn\\'t seem excessive to me since this would cover most of the sensible citizens and direct the uneducated to seek education. \\n5) Increasing pay and number of government employees (even politicians). Yes you heard me right, this is in accordance to the Singaporian model where the government employees are payed highly. The catch? Corruption should be monitored by a citizens council (atleast for the politicians), if anyone is found guilty they should face highly severe punishment. The reasons are quite obvious, more pay= less incentive to mess it all up by risking it all for a little extra through bribe etc. \\nConclusion: I have only discussed a few of the political changes suited for India here. But these changes can work to eliminate other social issues like extreme stress on our working class, pressure on students, control of rich over our country etc.... I\\'m sure noone will read this paragraph.',\n",

EVEN IF ONE GOT 720/720, A STUDENT CAN'T GET INTO AIIMS DELHI (50 SEATS vs 89 AIR-1s) \\r\\n2) ABSURD MARKS HAVE BEEN AWARDED LIKE- 719, 718 (BUT ONE CAN GET EITHER 715 OR 716 BECAUSE OF -1 NEGATIVE MARKING AND -4 MARKS IF Q. LEFT UNATTEMPTED).\\r\\n3) 10 STUDENTS FROM THE SAME CENTRE IN HARYANA SCORED 720/720. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE FROM SINGLE CENTRE 10 STUDENTS WITH CLOSE ROLL NOS. GOT AIR-1?? \\r\\n4) CUTOFFS SKY ROCKETED WITH A HUGE SUDDEN 240% INCREASE. 60-70 MARKS CUTOFF INCREASED, WHICH DOOMED FUTURE OF MANY DESERVING STUDENTS.\\r\\n5) NO PRESS COVERAGE AT ALL BECAUSE NEET RESULT WAS RELEASED AT THE SAME DAY AS ALL INDIA ELECTION RESULT (WHICH IS MORE IMP., OFC) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis needs immediate attention. NTA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MISHAP. NO PRESS CONFERENCE WAS GIVEN. \\r\\n\\r\\nREQUEST YOUR URGENT ATTENTION PLEASE DO RESEARCH AND MAKE VIDEOS REGARDING IT.

I even noticed and experienced it by my self! \\nExample no 1- \\nI applied for passport and I had to visit police station for police verification. I saw so many videos that they say police officer will ask for money but you must not pay them coz it\\'s free. While I was in police station, at the end of my interview, he said \"give me fees\", I said no coz ik the rules. Then he said you must pay me NOW. Then I said \"my uncle who is a IPS officer in katraj,   said not to pay coz it\\'s free and it\\'s your job to do\". Then he said \"call him\" then I took my phone to call he immediately said \"you can go now\".\\n\\nExample no 2- \\nI was going to after my highschool, I was little bit hungry so I stopped at wadapav shop to eat something, one police officer was also eating there. When I finished eating, I paid my bill but officer didn\\'t, when shop keeper said \"sir aapke 50rs hue\" to that police, he replied \"tu janta nahi kya muze? Naya he kyea?\". Then the owner of the shop came fast and said \"sir ye naya he, isse pata nhi AAP kon he, aap jayiye me isse baat karta hu\". \\n\\nThis is ridiculous. There are so many officer whose atitude towards normal people is not good! Even when my dad died in an accident 13 years ago! It was hit and run case but the driver who hit my dad was rich and he submitted all the documents wrong and he tried to coverup the case. My mom and I had to travel to court and home form 8 years, we almost gave up at that point. But at the end we captured him with arrest warrant and sent him to jail for 3 months, his wife came to negotiate with us. At the end they gave us 4.5 lakh rupees only. The cost of my dad\\'s death was 4.5 lakh? Really. We accepted that money only because we are tired of this and we had no power to fight for more! I was 7 years old when my dad died! \\nWe all say that this country is getting better but in reality it\\'s just cover of the book getting better but inside pages are rotten and burnt! \\nMe, and my lil brother is surviving because of my mom!

He was hit by the Toyota Fortuner driven by 19 year old Aashraya Sidana. The public caught him and handed him over to the police. The video on YT(Wronged) clearly showed Aashraya being handed to the police. Aashraya is the son of Shakti Sidana who is the owner of Pharma Co. Medwell Pacific in Jaipur. The following day the police mentioned that the culprit had fled the scene and there was no mention of Aashraya in the police report! Apparently, the police released him discreetly. He has been since seen clubbing and riding recklessly. He already had previous 4 over speeding offences.',\n",

Whatever happened was unfortunate, my blood was boiling when I got to know he got a bail within 15 hours. I tell you Friday Saturday Sunday night scene from kalyani Nagar to Kp, 14-15 years college students take drugs and alcohol. No bar owner asks them for a birth certificate if they're 21+ or not. Residential people  complain that they don't have a place for parking their own vehicle. This is a well organised racket and many authorities are involved. See na, under 18 was high, bar owner , bar manager who permitted him , his builder father immediately called MLA, MLA reached there 6am, no required action was taken by police, judges punished him with 300 words of essay. How fast he gets bail and how many people were involved This is the problem which needs to be addressed. No offence to anyone but mostly youngsters from other States living here are more addicted to pub culture. Agarwal is also not Maharashtrian.\",\n",

She was admitted to the hospital and after 3 days she died. Since then i am in Corsica, France. Soon after the accident i had to come France. The fault was her as the girl tried to cross the road even there was red signal for her. Because of her mistake i was bullied in my school and i had to leave India. Although i was at a speed of 110km/hr  but it was the National highway. My only mistake was i didn't had a license. Her family filed a case and took 80 lakh from us. I didn't had any fault except the license but i had to pay 80 lakh with a loss of my Mercedes . Although i am 19 now. Enjoying my life here\",\n",

My brother scumbed to his injuries during his comatose on 10th January 2022, the toughest day, month, week, year and a life full of tragedy and horrible memories. My brother had recently become a father and my nephew was just 6 weeks old when this happened. My bhabhi was going through postpartum and recovery after a complex childbirth. Imagine losing the only son of the house with aging parents and an unmarried daughter who was still in college. I will never forgive that bastard who killed my brother and shattered my beautiful family. Only I know what all we went through and how we had to let go of that careless guy because he was a few months away from being an adult. Shame on our government and judicial system.
